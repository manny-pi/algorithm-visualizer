<h1>Python Algorithm Visualizer</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
    The <em>Python Algorithm Visualizer</em> project is designed to facilitate the education of students in introductory Algorithms classes. In this project, I've implemented some of the most common algorithms that are learnt in introdcutory algorithms classes, as well as a few more advanced algorithms.
</p>

<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p>
    I started this project for two reasons: 
        <ol>
            <li>I know how much visualization aids the learning process, and</li>
            <li>This was a great opportunity for me to learn how to build systems with the goal of applying Design Principles</li>
        </ol>
</p>
<p> 
    Of the two reasons I gave, the 2nd is the biggest reason. I've implemented this visualizer project before, but the earlier iterations were done <em>very</em> sloppily, and weren't very extensible. So, I decided to refactor the entire project, and to apply Design Principles for Software Architecture. I recommened this project for Juniors/Seniors in a Computer Science program who want to do more than just implemented some methods, and really want to focus on building a system with strong architecture in mind.

<h2>Installation Guide</h2>
<p>
    <em>It's pretty simple to run this program. Just make sure you've completed MIT's Masters of Astrophysics, and Princeton's Graduate Machine Learning program, and you'll only need to complete 12 more degrees from Columbia, Brown, and Penn just to wrap your head around the first step of running this program!</em>
</p>
<p>
    But really, it's pretty straight-forward to use the program. Just follow the steps below:
    <ol>
        <li>Clone this repository using `git clone [<span style="color:red">link</span>]`</li>
        <li>Open the process.py file, and run it!</li>
    </ol>
